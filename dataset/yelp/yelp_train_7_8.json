The person who took my order was very good and she changed her gloves twice especially after handling money.  I was surprised to see the owner in the white shirt and the manager counting money without gloves.  The manager (gray shirt) did not wash his hands or use sanitizer afterwards.  Very unappetizing especially from management. You would think with the coronavirus going around he would be more careful especially being the manager.", "label": 2}, {"sentence1": "I wasn't so impressed with Frozeland. It is the self serve then weighed out style of froyo, I prefer that someone else does the pouring. Plus if you are not careful about the weight it can get close to $10 for a cup, if it is big. My biggest problem with their froyo was that the consistency seemed grainy. not the smooth kind I'm used to elsewhere.", "label": 2}, {"sentence1": "Nice atmosphere but I was seated on the hardest most uncomfortable chair imaginable.

Great downtown Austin alternative without the crazy waits! Great chilled atmosphere and good food and great bar! \nOur waiter Elliott was great, very nice and attentive. Explained menu well and recommended his favorite dishes.\nWell definitely be back soon.

It appeared as open on Yelp until 10:30. Got there at around 6 pm. A person sitting in front told us that restaurant is closed because they have a catering assignment. Really!!!

I come from a big Italian family and their food rivals even what my Grandma makes...now that's saying a lot! The service has always been very friendly, and although the ambiance leaves something to be desired, the service is always fast and efficient and the food more than makes up for it.

Our daughter had the eggs Benedict with the cheesy hashbrowns (YUMMM!) and my husband and I shared the prime rib dip and the tuna bake.
